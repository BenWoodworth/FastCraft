FastCraft v3 is being developed from the ground up in
[Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/). Why v3? This is the third re-write
since I first released the plugin in 2013, so 3.0 embodies the
progress made since its inception. This update will come with some big changes.
Firstly, the plugin will be developed for both
[Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/) and
[Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org/), and in such a way that
the same Jar will work on either platform.
