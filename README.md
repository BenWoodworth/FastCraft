# FastCraft v1
FastCraft+ is coming out of beta as FastCraft v1!

FastCraft v1 is being developed from the ground up in
[Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/). This update will come with some big changes.
Firstly, the plugin will be developed for both
[Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/) and
[Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org/), and in such a way that
the same Jar will work on either plaform. There will also be changes to the
feature set of the plugin. FastCraft 1.0 will drop the custom recipes functionality
and focus soley on the FastCraft user interface. Maintaining the extra functionality
has proven to be a hassle, and there are plenty of better recipe plugins out there to
do the job.

The rewrite of the plugin will be more rigerous, incorporating software design patterns
learned from my education and job experience in order to be more maintainable, as well
as unit testing, to better prevent issues from showing up between releases.
